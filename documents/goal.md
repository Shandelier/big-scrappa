## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and scalable web scraper that collects data from a fitness club management system. The scraper will be deployed in a cloud environment, such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Hetzner, and will provide real-time insights into club usage statistics. Additionally, the project aims to integrate with Telegram and OpenAI APIs to deliver engaging and informative updates to users.

## Current Status of the Works
1. **Web Scraping**: 
   - Implemented a Python-based scraper with session-based authentication to handle token expiration.
   - Successfully collects data every 10 minutes from WellFitness API.
   - Added data validation and error handling.
   - Improved gym location matching to ensure accurate data collection.

2. **Data Management**:
   - Migrated from local file storage to Supabase database.
   - Stores both processed stats and raw API responses in separate tables.
   - Implements data validation before storage to prevent bad data.
   - Standardized timestamp format for consistent data analysis.

3. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Simplified logging system for cloud deployment.
   - Added detailed debug logging for data processing steps.
   - Maintained health check endpoint for container monitoring.
   - Added validation warnings for suspicious member counts.

4. **Security and Configuration**:
   - Utilizes environment variables for managing sensitive information.
   - Validates all required credentials at startup.
   - Implements secure session-based authentication.
   - Added data structure validation for API responses.

5. **Telegram Bot Integration**:
   - Successfully implemented a Telegram bot for user interaction.
   - Provides real-time club statistics and usage data through chat commands.
   - Generates time series visualizations of club attendance.
   - Added Supabase integration for data retrieval.

6. **LLM Integration**:
   - Implemented Gemini API integration for natural conversations.
   - Added daily motivational messages sent at 17:10.
   - Created gym bro style responses for normal messages.
   - Customized responses based on user's goal progress.
   - Added daily gym tips with randomized topics.
   - Implemented retry mechanism for API failures (3 retries with exponential backoff).
   - Added rate limiting (14 RPM) to prevent API quota exhaustion.
   - Created preview test system for LLM responses with incremental logging.

## Next Steps

1. **Goal System Implementation**:
   - Add a /goal command to the Telegram bot.
   - Allow users to bet on their gym attendance (1-5 times per week).
   - Implement ban system for users who fail their goals.
   - Add image generation for disappointment messages.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Implement trend analysis for gym attendance.
   - Add peak hours detection.
   - Create weekly and monthly usage reports.
   
This setup enables real-time data collection and analysis, providing users with insightful and entertaining updates on club usage.
