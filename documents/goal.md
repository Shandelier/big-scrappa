i will give you my document with the goal and current status of the works. I would like you to advise me on the 
- infrastructure i should use. I have a feeling that GCP is too expensive and to slow to set up for this project. What are the alternatives? 
- is using docker the best approach? it adds a overhead to computation as well as engineering new features
- how should i set up the how shoudld i set up the storage? should i keep it in the compute instance or move it to a additional storage?
- what other features would be cool for the project? 

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and scalable web scraper that collects data from a fitness club management system. The scraper will be deployed in a cloud environment, such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Hetzner, and will provide real-time insights into club usage statistics. Additionally, the project aims to integrate with Telegram and OpenAI APIs to deliver engaging and informative updates to users.

## Current Status of the Works
1. **Web Scraping**: 
   - Implemented a Python-based scraper with session-based authentication to handle token expiration.
   - Successfully collects data every 10 minutes and processes it into structured CSV files.

2. **Data Management**:
   - Stores processed data in `clubs.csv` and `stats.csv`.
   - Maintains a backup of raw JSON responses with daily backups and a 7-day retention policy.

3. **Dockerization**:
   - Containerized the application using Docker and configured it for cloud deployment.
   - Set up `docker-compose.yml` with persistent volumes and environment variable management.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implemented structured logging with log rotation for both file and console outputs.
   - Added a health check endpoint for monitoring the container's status.

5. **Security and Configuration**:
   - Utilizes environment variables for managing sensitive information.
   - Provided a `.env.example` file for configuration guidance.

## Next Steps
1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Calculate additional statistics from the gathered data, such as the current number of people in the club and the maximum number of people in the club over the last 14 days.

2. **Telegram Integration**:
   - Integrate with a Telegram bot to allow users to request and receive current statistics via messaging.

3. **OpenAI API Integration**:
   - Use the OpenAI API to generate humorous and engaging responses from the Telegram bot, incorporating the calculated statistics.

This setup will enable real-time data collection and analysis, providing users with insightful and entertaining updates on club usage.
